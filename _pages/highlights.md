# Highlights

* 	First paper on [spiral cone-beam/multi-slice CT](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9155/52/6/R01) (1991) to solve "the long object problem" (longitudinal data truncation) (Modern CT scanners perform over 100-million scans annually, a majority of which are in the spiral cone-beam/multi-slice mode)
* 	Superiority of [spiral fan-beam CT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8208218) over step-and-shoot CT (1994)
* 	Over 100 follow-up papers on spiral/helical cone-beam/multi-slice/fan-beam CT, with a high number of citations ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pjK2mQwAAAAJ&hl=en))
* 	[Bioluminescence tomography](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1118/1.1766420) (2004) as a novel molecular imaging approach
* 	[Interior tomography](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23912256) (2007) to solve "the interior problem" (transverse data truncation). Interior tomography allows targeted imaging at low dose and fast speed
* 	State-of-the-art [multi-scale CT facility](https://phys.org/news/2009-09-virginia-tech-nano-ct-nano-scale.html) (2009) to perform nano-/micro-/conventional CT scans over six orders of magnitude in terms of image resolution and object size
* 	[Omni-tomography](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039700) (2011) for spatio-temporal fusion of tomographic imaging modalities, with [simultaneous CT-MRI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26429262) as an example
* 	[Spectrography](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22129733) (2011) for 3D ultrahigh resolution tomographic reconstruction from scattering by multi-energy coherent radiation ([In Focus News](http://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/1.9645!/import/pdf/480303a.pdf) in Nature)
* 	Axiomatic bibliometrics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23720314) (2013) to credit coauthors and rank institutions (in PNAS)
* 	[Perspective article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7733110/) (2016) on machine learning based tomographic image reconstruction
* 	[TMI Special issue](https://ieee-tmi.org/fast-facts/featured-article.asp?id=30&title=Special-Issue-on-Machine-Learning-for-Image-Reconstruction,-June-2018) (2018) dedicated to machine learning for image reconstruction
* 	Competitive performance (2019) of [modularized deep learning for low-dose CT imaging](http://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0057-9) relative to commercial iterative reconstruction (In [Nature Machine Intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0057-9))
* 	[IOP textbook on machine learning for tomographic reconstruction](https://iopscience.iop.org/book/978-0-7503-2216-4) (2019)
* 	[National Academy of Inventors](https://news.rpi.edu/content/2019/12/03/ge-wang-named-fellow-national-academy-inventors) (2019)
