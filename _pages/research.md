# Research

## Highlight

* First paper on [spiral cone-beam/multi-slice CT](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9155/52/6/R01) (1991) to solve "the long object problem" (longitudinal data truncation) (Modern CT scanners perform over 100-million scans annually, a majority of which are in the spiral cone-beam/multi-slice mode)
* Superiority of [spiral fan-beam CT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8208218) over step-and-shoot CT (1994)

## Cone-beam Spiral CT 

*	CT plays a central role in imaging, mainly achieved with spiral/helical cone-beam/multi-slice scanning. Ge Wang pioneered the first spiral cone-beam CT algorithms in 1991, has systematically working  on this topic with major and lasting impacts, and been recognized as Fellow of National Academy of Inventors. There are > 100M medical scans yearly, with a majority in the [spiral/helical cone-beam/multi-slice scanning mode](http://www.rdmag.com/award-winners/2014/08/flattening-yields-faster-ct) . Also, there are over 500-million [spiral cone-beam/multi-slice airport CT scans](http://www.dhs.gov/blog/2014/01/24/tsa-blog-year-review-2013). [Spiral cone-beam CT methods](http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9155/52/6/R01) have been extensively studied since 1991 (~2-million Google hits under alternative phrases) to solve this "long object problem" (longitudinal data truncation). 


## Fan-beam Spiral CT (Simpler/special case of cone-beam spiral CT)
*	A series of publications (1994-1997) establishing the superiority of spiral/helical fan-beam CT over the step-and-shoot scan mode that had been popular since the advent of CT. Our work was remarked in an editorial as “the state of the art in spiral CT” (Kalender, Radiology 197:578-580, 1995), having played a significant role in accelerating the transition into the spiral CT era.


## Interior Tomography & Omni-Tomography
*	[Breakthrough papers on interior tomography](http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9155/58/16/R161) to solve the long-standing “interior problem” (transverse data truncation) (2007-2013), with major practical benefits .
*	General interior tomography as a guiding principle that enables omni-tomography (2011) (“all-in-one”) to acquire different datasets (“all-at-once”), with simultaneous CT-MRI and simultaneous CT-SPECT as examples [[ref1](http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9155/58/16/R161), [ref2](http://medicalphysicsweb.org/cws/article/opinion/51026), [ref3](http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/imaging/path-found-to-a-combined-mri-and-ct-scanner)]

## Bioluminescence Tomography & Luminescence Tomography
*	[Initial papers](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v23/n3/pdf/nbt1074.pdf) on bioluminescence tomography (BLT) (2004), featured in Nature Biotechnology .
*	X-ray micro-modulated luminescence tomography (XMLT) (2014) as a new approach for microscopic imaging via combination of x-ray focusing and x-ray-induced luminescence emission.

## Bibliometrics
*	[Axiomatic index (A-index)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23720314) for quantification of individual academic credits to improve h- and other indices. This methodology was featured in [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/24/9615.extract), and used by [AMiner](http://arnetminer.org). Its application in assessing any NIH review bias was reported in [Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/seven-days-1-7-february-2013-1.12364) and [Science](http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2013/02/new-analysis-challenges-study-su.html).

## Auto-driving Vehicle-based Affordable Tomography-Analytics Robots (AVATAR)

Given unprecedented progresses in the engineering field over the past decade or so, the development of AVATAR is timely to integrate cutting-edge machine learning, auto-driving, medical imaging, robot, computer vision, virtual/mixed reality, high-performance computing, and internet technologies, and change the landscape of the imaging world. This is particularly helpful for cancer screening, diagnosis, and follow-up in underdeveloped countries. We are open to collaborate with those who are interested to address the healthcare needs in low-middle income countries (LMIC).
