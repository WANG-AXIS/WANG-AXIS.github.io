## Biomedical Imaging Center (BIC), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)

The mission of Biomedical Imaging Center (BIC) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) is to define and advance imaging frontiers, theories and technologies, realize clinical, preclinical and other potentials, as well as train scientists and engineers. BIC is directed by Dr. Ge Wang and occupies office and laboratory space of ~3,000sf in the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies (CBIS) (Figure 1), which ranks among the world's most advanced research facilities.


## AI-based X-ray Imaging System (AXIS) Lab:

This laboratory owns a Universal CT Bench-top system of $1M investment donated by GE Global Research Center (New York, USA), a grating-based x-ray Talbot-Lau interferometer developed under an NIH R01 support, and a photon-counting micro-CT scanner of $0.5M donated by MARS Bioimaging (Christchurch, New Zealand) (Figure 2).


## Universal CT Bench-top System:

The industrial universal CT bench-top system (Figure 3) emulates many CT configurations. This emulator can reveal physical effects like scatter that is difficult to simulate numerically. This system is critical for development of x-ray imaging technologies such as photon-counting detectors.
The system contains a medical x-ray source, a small flat panel detector, and a phantom stage. These are mounted on a set of high-accuracy PC-controlled translation and rotation stages (Figure 4). While the stages are steered, data can be acquired under a pre-defined protocol.
