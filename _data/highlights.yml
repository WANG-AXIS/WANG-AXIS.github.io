  description: In this Review, we provide a general background, highlight representative results with an emphasis on medical imaging, and discuss key issues that need to be addressed in this emerging field. In particular, tomographic imaging is an integral part of modern medicine, and will play a key role in personalized, preventive and precision medicine and make it intelligent, inexpensive and indiscriminate.

- title: "Machine Learning for Tomographic Imaging"
  image: MLTI_IOP.jpg
  description: We present a unified overview of deep-learning-based tomographic imaging. Key concepts, including classic reconstruction ideas and human vision inspired insights, are introduced as a foundation for a thorough examination of artificial neural networks and deep tomographic reconstruction. X-ray CT and MRI reconstruction methods are covered in detail, and other medical imaging applications are discussed as well.

- title: "Image Reconstruction is a New Frontier of Machine Learning"
  image: TMI_MLIC.jpg
  description: This is the first special issue dedicated to the theme of "Machine Learning for Image Reconstruction". In addition to well-known analytic and iterative methods for tomographic image reconstruction, machine learning is an emerging approach for image reconstruction, and likewise image reconstruction is a new frontier of machine learning. There are exciting research and application opportunities ahead for smart imaging and precision medicine.
