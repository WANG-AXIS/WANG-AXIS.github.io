- title: "Specialty-Oriented Generalist Medical AI for Chest CT Screening"
  image: SOGMAI.png
  description: Modern medical records include a vast amount of multimodal free text clinical data and imaging data from radiology, cardiology, and digital pathology. Fully mining such big data requires multitasking; otherwise, occult but important aspects may be overlooked, adversely affecting clinical management and population healthcare. Here we propose the first-of-its-kind medical multimodal-multitask foundation model (M3FM) with application in lung cancer screening and related tasks.

- title: "Learned Alternating Minimization Algorithm for Dual-domain Sparse-View CT Reconstruction"
  image: LAMA.png
  description: We propose a Learned Alternating Minimization Algorithm (LAMA) for dual-domain sparse-view CT image reconstruction. LAMA is induced by a variational model with learnable nonsmooth nonconvex regularizers, which are parameterized as composite functions of deep networks. We prove that LAMA is convergent for reliable image reconstruction.

- title: "Deep Learning for Tomographic Image Reconstruction"
  image: Nature-MI-DeepRecon.png
  description: In this Review, we provide a general background, highlight representative results with an emphasis on medical imaging, and discuss key issues that need to be addressed in this emerging field. In particular, tomographic imaging is an integral part of modern medicine, and will play a key role in personalized, preventive and precision medicine and make it intelligent, inexpensive and indiscriminate.

  description: This is the first special issue dedicated to the theme of "Machine Learning for Image Reconstruction". In addition to well-known analytic and iterative methods for tomographic image reconstruction, machine learning is an emerging approach for image reconstruction, and likewise image reconstruction is a new frontier of machine learning. There are exciting research and application opportunities ahead for smart imaging and precision medicine.
