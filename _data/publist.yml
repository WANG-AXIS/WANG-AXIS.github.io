- title: "Competitive performance of a modularized deep neural network compared to commercial algorithms for low-dose CT image reconstruction"
  image: NMI_LDCT.png
  description: Here, we design a modularized neural network for LDCT and compare it with commercial iterative reconstruction methods from three leading CT vendors. This study confirms that our deep learning approach performs either favourably or comparably in terms of noise suppression and structural fidelity, and is much faster than commercial iterative reconstruction algorithms.

- title: "Machine Learning for Tomographic Imaging"
  image: MLTI_IOP.jpg
  description: We present a unified overview of deep-learning-based tomographic imaging. Key concepts, including classic reconstruction ideas and human vision inspired insights, are introduced as a foundation for a thorough examination of artificial neural networks and deep tomographic reconstruction. X-ray CT and MRI reconstruction methods are covered in detail, and other medical imaging applications are discussed as well.

  description:
    We develop a simple model to interpret STM results on lightly doped Mott insulators, and find that the effective Mott gap measured by STM correspons to the one measured with other techniques when taking into account the poor electronic screeing.
